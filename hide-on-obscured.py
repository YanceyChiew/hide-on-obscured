# Attention:
# This script makes the window hidden when it was completely occuluded or minimized.
# There is no GDK_WINDOW_STATE_ICONIFIED in the 'pgi-docs/Gdk-3.0/enums.html#Gdk.EventType.WINDOW_STATE',
# and it is not obtained in practice, so it is hard to distinguish between being occluded and minimized.
#
# Before enabling this script, please make sure you have enabled the mpris (or similar) plugin too
# so that you can click the media controller from the notification area to retrieve the hidden window.
# Otherwise you may have to terminate the program running in the background via the console.
